What is the purpose of the delete operator in JavaScript?

The delete operator is used to remove properties from an object. It does not affect arrays or variables, only properties.

Example:
const person = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
delete person.age;
console.log(person);  // Output: { name: 'John' }
Note: delete returns true if the property is successfully deleted.

1. call()
The call() method invokes a function immediately with a specified this context and individual arguments.

const person = {
  fullName: function(city, country) {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} from ${city}, ${country}`;
  }
};

const person1 = { firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" };

console.log(person.fullName.call(person1, "New York", "USA"));
// Output: "John Doe from New York, USA"


Here, call() sets this to person1 and passes "New York" and "USA" as arguments to the fullName function.


2. apply()
The apply() method is similar to call(), but it accepts arguments as an array rather than individually.

const person = {
  fullName: function(city, country) {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} from ${city}, ${country}`;
  }
};

const person1 = { firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Smith" };

console.log(person.fullName.apply(person1, ["Paris", "France"]));
// Output: "Jane Smith from Paris, France"

In this example, apply() sets this to person1 and passes the array ["Paris", "France"] as arguments to fullName.


Key Difference Between call() and apply():
call() takes arguments individually.
apply() takes arguments as an array.


3. bind()
The bind() method returns a new function with a specified this context and, optionally, preset initial arguments. Unlike call() and apply(), it doesnâ€™t immediately execute the function but instead creates a new bound function that can be called later.

const person = {
  fullName: function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;
  }
};

const person1 = { firstName: "Emma", lastName: "Jones" };

const boundFullName = person.fullName.bind(person1);
console.log(boundFullName()); // Output: "Emma Jones"

Here, bind() creates a new function boundFullName where this is permanently set to person1. The new function can be invoked later and will always refer to person1 as this.
